✦ You are absolutely right. My apologies for jumping ahead and creating the file. You asked for a plan, and I should have provided just that.

  Here is a clear, cohesive game plan for a presentation that tells the complete story of LayerNorm, combining the best of all the materials we've developed.

  The Comprehensive LayerNorm Story: A Presentation Plan

  Theme: From Mathematical Necessity to High-Performance Reality

  Narrative Arc: Why -> What -> How -> Code

  ---

  Part 1: The "Why" - Establishing the Core Problem
   * Slide 1: Title Slide
       * Title: The Full Story of LayerNorm
       * Subtitle: From Mathematical Necessity to High-Performance Hardware Execution
       * Credit: Created by bashbash
   * Slide 2: The Core Problem - Internal Covariate Shift
       * Visual: Use the animated "flickering photo" from layernorm_photo_analogy.html.
       * Message: Introduce the concept of signal instability. A network layer receives inconsistent, unpredictable activations from the previous layer. How can it learn effectively?
   * Slide 3: The Goal - A Consistent Canvas
       * Visual: Show the "flickering photo" transforming into the stable, "neutral canvas" photo.
       * Message: The goal is to remove this statistical noise. We need to create a clean, predictable starting point before we can do meaningful work. This is what normalization achieves.

  Part 2: The "What" - The Architectural Revolution
   * Slide 4: The Critical Question - Where to Normalize?
       * Visual: Use the enhanced Pre-LN vs. Post-LN diagrams from layernorm_architectural_deep_dive.html.
       * Message: Introduce the two schools of thought. The placement of LayerNorm seems like a small detail, but it has profound implications for the network's stability.
   * Slide 5: The Consequence - The Gradient Superhighway
       * Visual: Use the powerful animated gradient flow SVG that shows the Post-LN gradient exploding and the Pre-LN gradient flowing cleanly.
       * Message: This is the payoff. Explain that Pre-LN protects the residual path, creating a "gradient superhighway" that allows gradients to flow unimpeded. This is the key to training very deep models.
   * Slide 6: The Practical Impact
       * Visual: A simple, clean table or two-column text layout comparing BERT and GPT-2.
       * Message: Connect the architectural choice to real-world consequences. Discuss the need for learning rate warmups in Post-LN (BERT) and the inherent stability and scalability of Pre-LN (GPT-2 and beyond).

  Part 3: The "How" - The HPC Implementation
   * Slide 7: The Full Stack View - From Memory to Silicon
       * Visual: Use the master HPC Deep Dive infographic from layernorm_hpc_deep_dive.html.
       * Message: Now that we know why and what, let's see how it's done efficiently. This slide shows the entire journey of the data for a single LayerNorm operation.
   * Slide 8: A Single Token's Journey
       * Visual: Use the simplified infographic from layernorm_hpc_deep_dive.html that focuses on just one token vector.
       * Message: Let's zoom in. Explain that the core operation happens on a single 1D vector of embed_dim features. Clarify the dimensions of gamma and beta ([C]) and how they are broadcast.
   * Slide 9: Hiding Latency - The Streaming Optimization
       * Visual: Use the animated prefetching SVG from layernorm_streaming_optimization_v2.html.
       * Message: The final optimization is hiding memory latency. Explain how _mm_prefetch ensures the CPU's execution units are never idle, creating a seamless flow of data.

  Part 4: The Code - Grounding Theory in Reality
   * Slide 10: The Math Breakdown
       * Visual: Use the clean LaTeX formulas from layernorm_math_breakdown.html.
       * Message: Briefly recap the step-by-step math (μ, σ², normalization, scale/shift) to connect the high-level concepts to the precise calculations.
   * Slide 11: The C/AVX Implementation
       * Visual: Show the final, optimized C code snippet with the #pragma omp parallel for and the AVX intrinsics.
       * Message: This is the code that implements everything we've discussed: the token-level parallelism, the vectorized math, and the prefetching, all operating on the data within our bump-allocated memory arena.

  Part 5: Conclusion
   * Slide 12: The Full Story, Summarized
       * Visual: A clean, text-based summary slide.
       * Message: Recap the four acts: The mathematical need for stability, the architectural innovation of Pre-LN, the full-stack HPC implementation that makes it fast, and the code that makes it real. Emphasize
         that modern AI is a result of the synergy between all these layers of understanding.

  This game plan creates a powerful, logical, and visually engaging narrative that will take your audience on a complete journey of discovery. It sounds excellent.
